#Random-Password-Generator

We use passwords everyday and a large majority of people use the same password over and over again for various accounts. Some may use the same passwords for their online banking as well as their social media. A random password generator is not an original solution to that problem whatsoever, however i wanted to create one that could include a variety of letters/characters and numbers if you so choose to want them included. This could also be used as random number generators/ random letter generators etc. 

What makes this different from normal password generators is that you have the choice of how many characters you would like, weather to inlcudes numbers, special characters, lower or upper case letters. 

Coded primarly  using javascript by using arrays, if statements, functions, window.prompts/alert/confirm, math randoms, concat and many more.

This is a mini project ive created after 1 week of learning javascript. It was a major challenge fine tuning the javascript code within. Below are screenshots of the project.
